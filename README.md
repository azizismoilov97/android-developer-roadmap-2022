<h1 align="center">üë®‚Äçüíª Android Developer Roadmap 2022</h1></br>

Android Developer Roadmap 2022 suggests learning paths to understanding Android development. You can read the roadmap following the line path in the middle of the map. <br>

Each node indicates concepts of Android systems, Android SDK, and generally used libraries. It would be helpful to refer to the [Android Developers Reference](https://developer.android.com/reference) or GitHub for the specific terminologies. <br>

In addition, **you don't need to learn everything from this roadmap**. So we recommend only reading the sections that would be helpful to you.
